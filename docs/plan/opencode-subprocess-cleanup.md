# OpenCode Subprocess Cleanup Plan

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-04

## Overview

This plan ensures all OpenCode subprocesses are properly stopped and cleaned up during server shutdown scenarios (both clean and dirty shutdowns). Currently, the workspace manager spawns OpenCode subprocesses but lacks comprehensive cleanup handlers for various shutdown scenarios, potentially leaving zombie processes.

## Progress Tracking

- [x] **Phase 1**: Global Process Cleanup Handler *(4/4 tasks)* ✅ *Completed 2025-08-04*
- [x] **Phase 2**: Enhanced Workspace Manager *(5/5 tasks)* ✅ *Completed 2025-08-04*
- [x] **Phase 3**: Next.js Integration & Coordination *(4/4 tasks)* ✅ *Completed 2025-08-04*
- [x] **Phase 4**: Testing & Monitoring *(4/4 tasks)* ✅ *Completed 2025-08-04*

## Current Issues Identified

### Critical Problems
1. **No global shutdown handlers** - No listeners for SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT process signals
2. **Unhandled crash scenarios** - No cleanup on uncaughtException or unhandledRejection
3. **Potential zombie processes** - OpenCode subprocesses could become orphaned if main process dies
4. **Race conditions** - Multiple shutdown events could interfere with cleanup
5. **No Next.js lifecycle integration** - Not hooked into Next.js server shutdown process

### Current Cleanup Limitations
- `stopWorkspace()` only handles individual workspace cleanup
- `stopAllWorkspaces()` exists but isn't called on process termination
- Process cleanup uses basic SIGTERM → SIGKILL pattern without verification
- No process group management for nested processes
- No cleanup retry logic or error recovery

---

## Phase 1: Global Process Cleanup Handler
**Status**: ✅ Completed 2025-08-04

    timeout?: number; // Max time allowed for cleanup
  }

  class ProcessCleanupManager {
    private handlers: CleanupHandler[] = [];
    private isShuttingDown: boolean = false;
    private shutdownPromise?: Promise<void>;
    
    registerHandler(handler: CleanupHandler): void;
    unregisterHandler(name: string): void;

  ```typescript
  // Handle all relevant process signals
  const signals = ['SIGTERM', 'SIGINT', 'SIGQUIT', 'SIGHUP'] as const;
  
  signals.forEach(signal => {
    process.on(signal, async () => {
      console.log(`Received ${signal}, initiating graceful shutdown...`);
      await cleanupManager.initiateShutdown(signal);
      process.exit(0);
    });
  });
  ```
  
  **Implementation Notes:**

  ```typescript
  // Handle unhandled exceptions
  process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
    console.error('Uncaught Exception:', error);
    await cleanupManager.initiateShutdown('uncaughtException');
    process.exit(1);
  });

  process.on('unhandledRejection', async (reason, promise) => {
    console.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
    await cleanupManager.initiateShutdown('unhandledRejection');
    process.exit(1);
  });
  ```
  
  **Implementation Notes:**
  - Added `initializeExceptionHandlers()` function to `src/lib/process-cleanup.ts`

- [x] ~~**1.4** Implement graceful shutdown with timeout~~ ✅ *Completed 2025-08-04*
  ```typescript
  interface ShutdownConfig {
    gracefulTimeout: number; // Default: 10 seconds
    forceTimeout: number;    // Default: 5 seconds
    retryAttempts: number;   // Default: 3
    retryDelay: number;      // Default: 1 second
  }
  
  // Graceful shutdown with fallback to force termination
  // Cleanup verification and retry logic
  // Comprehensive logging for debugging
  ```
  
  **Implementation Notes:**
  - Extended `ShutdownConfig` interface with `forceTimeout`, `retryAttempts`, and `retryDelay` properties

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Build the foundation with process cleanup manager
2. **Enhance existing code** - Improve workspace manager incrementally
3. **Add integration points** - Hook into Next.js lifecycle carefully
4. **Test thoroughly** - Validate each phase before moving to the next

### Rollout Plan
```typescript
// Feature flag for gradual rollout
const CLEANUP_CONFIG = {
  enableGlobalHandlers: process.env.ENABLE_PROCESS_CLEANUP === 'true',
  enableProcessMonitoring: process.env.ENABLE_PROCESS_MONITORING === 'true',
  enableMetrics: process.env.ENABLE_CLEANUP_METRICS === 'true',
  gracefulTimeout: parseInt(process.env.CLEANUP_TIMEOUT || '10000'),
};
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing `stopWorkspace()` and `stopAllWorkspaces()` methods remain functional
- New cleanup handlers are additive, not replacing existing logic
- Configuration-driven feature enablement
- Graceful degradation if cleanup handlers fail

---

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Cleanup Failure Scenarios
1. **Process won't terminate** - Escalate from SIGTERM to SIGKILL
2. **Cleanup timeout** - Log error and continue with other processes
3. **Multiple shutdown signals** - Prevent duplicate cleanup attempts
4. **Cleanup handler crashes** - Isolate failures and continue with other handlers

### Recovery Mechanisms
```typescript
// Cleanup verification and recovery
async function verifyCleanup(workspaceId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const workspace = this.workspaces.get(workspaceId);
  if (!workspace?.process) return true;
  
  // Check if process is actually dead
  try {
    process.kill(workspace.process.pid!, 0); // Signal 0 checks if process exists
    return false; // Process still exists
  } catch (error) {
    return true; // Process is dead
  }
}

// Orphaned process recovery
async function cleanupOrphanedProcesses(): Promise<void> {
  // Find and terminate any OpenCode processes that aren't tracked
  // Use system commands to find processes by name/command
  // Clean up any remaining OpenCode processes
}
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Process Security
- **Principle of least privilege** - Only terminate processes we own
- **Process validation** - Verify process identity before termination
- **Signal handling security** - Prevent signal injection attacks
- **Resource cleanup** - Ensure no sensitive data remains in memory

### Implementation Security
```typescript
// Secure process termination
async function secureProcessTermination(process: ChildProcess): Promise<void> {
  // Validate process ownership
  if (process.pid && !isOwnedProcess(process.pid)) {
    throw new Error('Cannot terminate process not owned by this application');
  }
  
  // Clear sensitive data from process memory if possible
  await clearProcessMemory(process);
  
  // Terminate securely
  await terminateProcess(process);
}
```

## Performance Impact

### Optimization Strategies
- **Lazy initialization** - Only initialize cleanup handlers when needed
- **Efficient monitoring** - Use minimal resources for process health checks
- **Batch operations** - Group cleanup operations where possible
- **Timeout management** - Prevent cleanup from blocking indefinitely

### Performance Metrics
- Cleanup handler initialization time: < 100ms
- Individual workspace cleanup time: < 2 seconds
- Total shutdown time: < 15 seconds (configurable)
- Memory overhead: < 1MB for cleanup infrastructure
