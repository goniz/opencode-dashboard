# OpenCode Dashboard UI/UX Refactor Plan - Status Report

## Plan Creation Status: COMPLETE

The detailed implementation plan for refactoring the OpenCode Dashboard UI/UX to match the Google Jules Async Agent interface has been successfully created and saved to:
`docs/plan/google-jules-async-agent-ui-ux-refactor.md`

## Implementation Progress:

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Task 1.2: State Management for Workspaces as Tasks** - COMPLETED
   - Enhanced `src/hooks/useTasks.ts` with comprehensive task management functionality
   - Implemented task data structures mapping to workspaces
   - Added task status management (pending, in-progress, completed, failed)
   - Implemented plan state management within tasks
   - Added task creation/update functions
   - Integrated with `/api/workspaces` for task/workspace creation
   - Integrated with `/api/agent/plan` for plan generation
   - Reused existing workspace data structures and SSE update handling

## Key Deliverables Created:

1. **Main Implementation Plan**: 
   - File: `docs/plan/google-jules-async-agent-ui-ux-refactor.md`
   - Comprehensive 417-line document detailing the refactor approach
   - Includes parallelization information for all phases and tasks

2. **Implementation Summary**:
   - File: `docs/plan/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - High-level overview of the refactor plan
   - Summary of parallel implementation opportunities

## Plan Highlights:

### Core Architecture Changes:
- Simplified three-view system (Sidebar, New Workspace, Chat)
- Dark theme with purple accent colors
- Enhanced plan visualization and approval workflow

### Parallel Implementation Opportunities:
- Phase 1: Foundation tasks can be done in parallel (Context, UI components, Layout)
- Phase 2: Core features can be implemented concurrently (API integration, workflows)
- Phase 3: All enhancement tasks can be done in parallel
- Phase 4: Testing and refinement can be parallelized

### Component Development:
- OpenCodeSidebar (replaces WorkspaceManager)
- NewWorkspaceForm (replaces QuickStart)
- WorkspaceChat (enhanced chat interface)
- TaskContext (extended state management)

## Next Steps:

The plan is now ready for implementation by development teams. Key parallelization opportunities have been identified to enable efficient concurrent development across multiple developers or teams.

The plan maintains backward compatibility with existing OpenCode functionality while providing a modern, Google Jules-inspired UI/UX.
