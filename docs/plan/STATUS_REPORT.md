# OpenCode Dashboard UI/UX Refactor Plan - Status Report

## Plan Creation Status: COMPLETE

The detailed implementation plan for refactoring the OpenCode Dashboard UI/UX to match the Google Jules Async Agent interface has been successfully created and saved to:
`docs/plan/google-jules-async-agent-ui-ux-refactor.md`

## Implementation Progress:

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Task 1.2: State Management for Workspaces as Tasks** - COMPLETED
   - Enhanced `src/hooks/useTasks.ts` with comprehensive task management functionality
   - Implemented task data structures mapping to workspaces
   - Added task status management (pending, in-progress, completed, failed)
   - Implemented plan state management within tasks
   - Added task creation/update functions
   - Integrated with `/api/workspaces` for task/workspace creation
   - Integrated with `/api/agent/plan` for plan generation
   - Reused existing workspace data structures and SSE update handling

2. **OpenCodeSidebar Component Implementation** - COMPLETED
   - Created `OpenCodeSidebar` component in `src/components/ui/opencode-sidebar.tsx`
   - Implemented workspace list with status indicators (running, stopped, error)
   - Added search functionality for filtering workspaces and codebases
   - Integrated "New Workspace" button
   - Added codebase navigation section
   - Implemented bottom navigation links (Docs, Community, Settings)
   - Connected component to `useTaskContext` for data management

3. **NewWorkspaceForm Component Implementation** - COMPLETED
   - Created `NewWorkspaceForm` component in `src/components/ui/new-workspace-form.tsx`
   - Implemented folder selection with integrated folder browser
   - Added simplified workflow without immediate model selection
   - Integrated with `useTaskContext` for workspace creation
   - Designed with Google Jules dark theme styling (purple accents)
   - Added back navigation to sidebar view

4. **Root Layout Update** - COMPLETED
   - Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to use `TaskProvider` instead of `OpenCodeSessionProvider`
   - Added default dark theme background colors
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

5. **Google Jules Dark Theme Implementation** - COMPLETED
   - Updated `src/app/globals.css` with Google Jules color palette
   - Implemented dark theme as default (gray-900 background with white text)
   - Added purple accent colors for primary actions and UI elements
   - Added status colors for workspace states
   - Created custom component styles for buttons and status indicators

6. **WorkspaceChat Component Implementation** - COMPLETED
   - Created `WorkspaceChat` component in `src/components/ui/workspace-chat.tsx`
   - Implemented chat interface with integrated plan visualization
   - Added plan approval/rejection workflow
   - Integrated with `useTaskContext` for task and plan management
   - Designed with Google Jules dark theme styling (purple accents)
   - Added back navigation to sidebar view
   - Integrated existing OpenCode chat functionality through Thread component

## Key Deliverables Created:

1. **Main Implementation Plan**: 
   - File: `docs/plan/google-jules-async-agent-ui-ux-refactor.md`
   - Comprehensive 417-line document detailing the refactor approach
   - Includes parallelization information for all phases and tasks

2. **Implementation Summary**:
   - File: `docs/plan/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - High-level overview of the refactor plan
   - Summary of parallel implementation opportunities

## Plan Highlights:

### Core Architecture Changes:
- Simplified three-view system (Sidebar, New Workspace, Chat)
- Dark theme with purple accent colors
- Enhanced plan visualization and approval workflow

### Parallel Implementation Opportunities:
- Phase 1: Foundation tasks can be done in parallel (Context, UI components, Layout)
- Phase 2: Core features can be implemented concurrently (API integration, workflows)
- Phase 3: All enhancement tasks can be done in parallel
- Phase 4: Testing and refinement can be parallelized

### Component Development:
- OpenCodeSidebar (replaces WorkspaceManager)
- NewWorkspaceForm (replaces QuickStart)
- WorkspaceChat (enhanced chat interface)
- TaskContext (extended state management)

## Next Steps:

The plan is now ready for implementation by development teams. Key parallelization opportunities have been identified to enable efficient concurrent development across multiple developers or teams.

The plan maintains backward compatibility with existing OpenCode functionality while providing a modern, Google Jules-inspired UI/UX.
