## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Architecture Changes
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.component {
  /* Mobile styles (default) */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .component {
    /* Tablet styles */
    flex-direction: row;
    padding: 1.5rem;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .component {
    /* Desktop styles */
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}
```

### Responsive Component Pattern
```typescript
interface ResponsiveComponentProps {
  className?: string;
  isMobile?: boolean;
  isTablet?: boolean;
  isDesktop?: boolean;
}

const ResponsiveComponent = ({ className, ...props }: ResponsiveComponentProps) => {
  return (
    <div className={cn(
      "flex flex-col", // Mobile default
      "md:flex-row",   // Tablet+
      "lg:gap-6",      // Desktop+
      className
    )}>
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Touch Target Guidelines
- Minimum touch target: 44px √ó 44px
