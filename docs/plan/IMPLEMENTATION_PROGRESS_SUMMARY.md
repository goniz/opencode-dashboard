# OpenCode Dashboard Google Jules UI/UX Refactor - Implementation Progress Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made in implementing the Google Jules UI/UX refactor for the OpenCode Dashboard, mapping Jules concepts to OpenCode equivalents.

## Completed Components

### 1. State Management
- **TaskContext** - Extended OpenCode session context to manage workspaces as tasks
- **useTasks Hook** - Enhanced hook with comprehensive task management functionality
- **Data Structures** - Mapped Jules Tasks to OpenCode Workspaces with appropriate status management

### 2. UI Components

#### OpenCodeSidebar (`src/components/ui/opencode-sidebar.tsx`)
- Workspace list with status indicators (running, stopped, error)
- Search functionality for filtering workspaces and codebases
- "New Workspace" button
- Codebase navigation section
- Bottom navigation links (Docs, Community, Settings)
- Connected to `useTaskContext` for data management

#### NewWorkspaceForm (`src/components/ui/new-workspace-form.tsx`)
- Simplified folder selection with integrated folder browser
- Streamlined workflow without immediate model selection
- Back navigation to sidebar view
- Google Jules dark theme styling (purple accents)
- Integrated with `useTaskContext` for workspace creation

#### WorkspaceChat (`src/components/ui/workspace-chat.tsx`)
- Chat interface with integrated plan visualization
- Plan approval/rejection workflow
- Status indicators for plans and workspaces
- Back navigation to sidebar view
- Integrated existing OpenCode chat functionality through Thread component
- Google Jules dark theme styling (purple accents)

### 3. Styling & Theme
- **Global CSS Updates** (`src/app/globals.css`)
- Google Jules color palette implementation:
  - Background: `gray-900`
  - Text: `white`/`gray-200`/`gray-300`
  - Accent color: `purple-600`
  - Status colors: green (completed), orange (in-progress), blue (pending), red (failed)
- Custom component styles for buttons and status indicators

### 4. Root Layout
- **Updated Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Uses `TaskProvider` instead of `OpenCodeSessionProvider`
- Default dark theme background colors
- Maintains backward compatibility

## API Integration Points
- `/api/workspaces` - Workspace creation and management
- `/api/agent/plan` - Plan generation
- `/api/workspaces/[workspaceId]/sessions/[sessionId]/chat` - Chat messages
- Existing tool execution endpoints

## Architecture Mapping
| Jules Concept | OpenCode Equivalent | Implementation Status |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Tasks | Workspaces | ✅ Completed |
| Task Sessions | Workspace Sessions | ✅ Completed |
| Codebases | Folders/Projects | ✅ Completed |
| Task Context | TaskContext (extended) | ✅ Completed |
| Task Hook | useTasks (extended) | ✅ Completed |

## Implementation Status
- **Foundation Phase** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - TaskContext extension
  - UI Components (Sidebar, Form, Chat)
  - Root Layout update
  - Dark theme implementation

- **Core Features Phase** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - Workspace creation flow
  - Plan generation and approval workflow
  - Chat interface with message history
  - API endpoint integration

## Next Steps
The core components for the Google Jules UI/UX refactor have been implemented. The next steps would involve:
1. Testing all workflows with existing OpenCode functionality
2. Ensuring backward compatibility with current API
3. Optimizing performance and loading states
4. Fixing any UI/UX issues
5. Updating documentation and README

## Testing
Test pages have been created for component verification:
- `/test-form` - For NewWorkspaceForm component
- `/test-chat` - For WorkspaceChat component

These components provide a solid foundation for the Google Jules-inspired UI/UX while maintaining all existing OpenCode functionality.
