# OpenCode Dashboard Google Jules UI/UX Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the key aspects of the UI/UX refactor plan to transform the OpenCode Dashboard into a Google Jules-like interface while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Components to Implement
1. **OpenCodeSidebar** - Replaces current workspace manager
2. **NewWorkspaceForm** - Replaces current quick start
3. **WorkspaceChat** - Enhanced chat interface with plan execution
4. **TaskContext** - Extended state management system

## Parallel Implementation Opportunities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- **TaskContext** and **Root Layout** updates (parallel)
- **UI Components** development (parallel):
  - OpenCodeSidebar
  - NewWorkspaceForm
  - WorkspaceChat

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
- **API Integration** (parallel):
  - Workspace creation flow
  - Plan generation workflow
  - Chat interface
  - Existing endpoint integration

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)
All enhancement tasks can be done in parallel:
- Command execution visualization
- Status indicators and progress tracking
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Mobile responsiveness
- Animations and transitions

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Week 4)
- Workflow testing and compatibility verification (parallel)
- Performance optimization and UI/UX fixes (parallel)
- Documentation updates (sequential, after testing)

## Technical Approach
- Extend existing OpenCodeSessionContext rather than replace
- Reuse current API endpoints with enhanced UI
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Implement dark theme with purple accent colors
- Optimize for mobile with bottom navigation

## Expected Outcomes
- Simplified three-view navigation system
- Enhanced plan visualization and approval workflow
- Improved chat experience with integrated command execution
- Consistent styling and improved visual hierarchy
- Better mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

This refactor will modernize the OpenCode Dashboard UI/UX while preserving all existing functionality and API compatibility.
